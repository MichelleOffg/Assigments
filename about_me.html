        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <div>
          My name is Michelle Offiong. I am a student of the
          prestigious University of Calabar and I'm currently
          reading pharmacy. I am a seasoned and experienced
          writer and an avid lover of books. I'm an advocate
          for self-love and healing.

          Inasmuch as I'm an introverted person, I enjoy doing
          a few things in my little corner. Some of my hobbies
          include reading, writing, sleeping, listening to
          music, traveling, to mention but a few.

          My top priority as of right now is to break into the
          tech space and make a name for myself. Attending the
          Zuri training puts me on the right path to achieving
          this goal. My top three(3) skills include writing,
          interpersonal communication and creativity. I pride
          myself on my emotional intelligence. It has proved
          handy in sticky situation.
